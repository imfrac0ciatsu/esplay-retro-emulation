## How to Download and Install Paint Tool SAI 1.1.0
 
Paint Tool SAI 1.1.0 is a commercial software that requires a license to use it after a 31-day trial period. You can download the trial version from the official website[^2^] or from other sources[^1^] [^4^]. To install it, you need to unzip the downloaded file and run the setup.exe file. You can choose the installation folder, but it is recommended to avoid the "Program Files" folder on Windows Vista or later because of the User Account Control (UAC) issues[^2^]. After the installation, you can run the sai.exe file to start the program.
 
## How to Use Paint Tool SAI 1.1.0
 
Paint Tool SAI 1.1.0 has a simple but powerful user interface that is easy to learn and use. The main window consists of four parts: the menu bar, the tool panel, the canvas, and the layer panel.
 
- The menu bar contains various commands and options for file management, editing, view, canvas, layer, selection, filter, and help.
- The tool panel contains different drawing tools, such as airbrush, watercolor, pen, marker, eraser, bucket, selection, move, zoom, rotate, hand, and color picker. You can customize each tool's settings by clicking on the "Advanced Settings" button at the bottom of the panel.
- The canvas is where you draw your artwork. You can use your mouse or a digitizer with pressure support to create smooth and anti-aliased strokes[^2^]. You can also use keyboard shortcuts to perform common actions, such as undo (Ctrl+Z), redo (Ctrl+Y), copy (Ctrl+C), paste (Ctrl+V), cut (Ctrl+X), select all (Ctrl+A), deselect (Ctrl+D), flip horizontal (H), flip vertical (V), rotate clockwise (R), rotate counterclockwise (L), zoom in (+), zoom out (-), fit to screen (F), and reset rotation (Q).
- The layer panel shows the list of layers in your artwork. You can add, delete, duplicate, merge, rename, lock, hide, and change the order and opacity of layers. You can also use different blending modes to create various effects on your layers.

## Some Tips for Using Paint Tool SAI 1.1.0
 
Here are some tips to help you make the most of Paint Tool SAI 1.1.0:

- Use vector tools for inking your sketches. Vector tools are located at the bottom of the tool panel and they allow you to create smooth and scalable lines that can be edited by other vector tools[^2^]. You can also convert raster layers to vector layers by right-clicking on them and choosing "Convert Layer Type".
- Use clipping groups to apply colors and shading to your drawings without affecting the outlines. Clipping groups are layers that are clipped by the layer below them and only show where they overlap[^3^]. To create a clipping group, right-click on a layer and choose "Clipping Group". You can then paint on that layer with any color or tool without going outside the boundaries of the base layer.
- Use filters to enhance your artwork with various effects. Filters are located in the menu bar under "Filter" and they allow you to adjust brightness/contrast, hue/saturation/luminance, color balance, blur/sharpen, noise reduction/addition[^2^]. You can also use filters on selected areas by using the selection tools before applying them.
