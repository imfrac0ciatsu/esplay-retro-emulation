## Examples of Paradigm Geolog 7 2011.1 in Action
 
Paradigm Geolog 7 2011.1 is a software package that has been used by many oil and gas companies around the world for over 30 years. Here are some examples of how Paradigm Geolog 7 2011.1 has helped our customers to solve their challenges and improve their outcomes:

- A major operator in the Middle East used Paradigm Geolog 7 2011.1 to perform a comprehensive petrophysical evaluation of a complex carbonate reservoir. The operator applied a multi-mineral model with Monte Carlo uncertainty analysis to estimate the porosity, permeability, water saturation, net pay, and hydrocarbon in place. The operator also used the 3D petrophysics feature to visualize the spatial distribution of the petrophysical properties and identify the sweet spots in the reservoir.
- A leading service company in North America used Paradigm Geolog 7 2011.1 to perform a detailed geomechanical analysis of a shale gas well. The service company used the geomechanical module to calculate the stress profile, rock strength, pore pressure, fracture gradient, minimum horizontal stress, and maximum horizontal stress along the wellbore. The service company also used the fracture modeling feature to simulate the hydraulic fracturing process and optimize the fracture design and placement.
- A national oil company in South America used Paradigm Geolog 7 2011.1 to perform a comprehensive sequence stratigraphic analysis of a deepwater turbidite reservoir. The company used the sequence stratigraphy module to identify the depositional environments, facies associations, systems tracts, sequences, parasequences, surfaces, boundaries, and cycles in the reservoir. The company also used the lithology and facies analysis feature to classify the log responses into different lithofacies and facies groups based on their petrophysical characteristics.
