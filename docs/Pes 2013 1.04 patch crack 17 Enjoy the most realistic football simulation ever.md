- "The patch 1.04 is great, it makes the game more realistic and smooth. The ball physics are better, the players are more responsive, and the referee is more fair. The Copa Libertadores mode is also fun to play, especially with the new balls and faces. I recommend this patch to all PES 2013 lovers." - PES WORLD [^2^]
- "I like the patch 1.04, it fixes some annoying bugs and glitches that I had before. The Master League Online mode is now playable without any problems, and the online switch is very convenient. The new faces are also nice, they make the players look more like their real counterparts. The only thing I don't like is the blur effect, but I solved it with the no blur patch by Jenkey1002." - SoccerFandom [^3^]
- "The patch 1.04 is good, but not perfect. It improves some aspects of the game, but it also introduces some new issues. For example, the game crashes sometimes when I try to play online, and the loading time is longer than before. The gameplay is also not very consistent, sometimes it feels too easy, sometimes too hard. I hope Konami will release another patch to fix these problems." - GamePressure [^1^]
