You can choose from low-pass, high-pass, band-pass, notch, comb, formant, vowel, phaser, and more. You can also adjust the Cutoff, Resonance, Drive, Keytrack, and Env Amount parameters to fine-tune the filter response.
- To add more movement and expression to the sound, you can use the Arp section to activate one or two arpeggiators. You can choose from different modes, patterns, speeds, lengths, and directions. You can also program your own sequences or load MIDI files as arpeggiator sources.
- To enhance the sound further, you can use the FX section to apply different types of effects. You can choose from distortion, chorus, flanger, phaser, EQ, delay, reverb, shimmer hall, and more.
