The story of Savitri and Satyavan is one of the most popular and inspiring stories in Indian mythology. It is a story of a woman's loyalty, determination and power to defy death for her husband. Savitri was the daughter of King Ashwapati, who was blessed by the goddess Savitri to have a daughter with the same name. Savitri was a beautiful and virtuous princess who chose Satyavan as her husband, despite knowing that he was cursed to die within a year. She followed him to the forest and lived a simple life with him and his parents.
 
On the day of Satyavan's death, Savitri accompanied him to the woods where he was cutting wood. There, he fell down and died in her lap. Savitri saw the god of death, Yama, coming to take his soul. She pleaded with him to spare her husband, but he refused. She then followed him as he carried Satyavan's soul away. She impressed Yama with her wisdom and devotion and asked him for three boons: first, that her father-in-law regain his eyesight and kingdom; second, that her father have a hundred sons; and third, that she have a hundred sons with Satyavan. Yama granted all her boons, but realized that he had unwittingly given back Satyavan's life as well. He praised Savitri for her cleverness and faithfulness and returned her husband to her. Savitri and Satyavan lived happily ever after.
 
Satya Savithri Ani Satyawan Marathi Movie 44 is a modern adaptation of this classic tale that explores how Savitri's character and choices would be different in today's world. The film also raises questions about fate, free will and love in the context of contemporary society. The film is a tribute to the spirit of womanhood and the power of true love.
