Call of Duty: Black Ops is one of the most popular first-person shooter games of all time, featuring a cinematic single-player campaign, a signature multiplayer mode, and a thrilling zombies mode. If you want to play this game on your PC with all the DLCs and modes included, you will need to download a repack version that has been cracked by some groups. In this article, we will show you how to do that and how to enjoy the game with your friends or bots.
 
## Step 1: Download the Repack Version
 
There are many repack versions of Call of Duty: Black Ops available on the internet, but we recommend you to use the one based on Call.of.Duty.Black.Ops.MULTi6-PLAZA ISO release[^1^] [^2^]. This repack has a size of 7~7.3 GB for any single language and includes all the DLCs and modes. You can download it from various torrent sites or file hosters, such as ExtraTorrent, Kickass Torrents, RuTor, FreeTorrents, Tapochek.net, MultiUpload or FileCorn[^1^] [^2^]. Make sure to choose the language pack you want and skip the ones you don't need.

## Step 2: Install the Repack Version
 
After downloading the repack version, you need to install it on your PC. The installation process may take 30-60 minutes depending on your system. You will need 12 GB of HDD space after installation. Follow the instructions on the screen and wait until it finishes. After-install integrity check will make sure that everything installed properly.
 
## Step 3: Choose Your Crack
 
The repack version comes with two cracks: PLAZA and BGamerT5[^1^] [^2^]. PLAZA crack allows you to play single-player and multiplayer with bots, but not zombies or multiplayer with friends. BGamerT5 crack allows you to play zombies, multiplayer with bots and multiplayer with friends[^3^]. You can find both cracks in the NoDVD folder after installation. Choose the one that suits your preference and copy it to the game folder, replacing the original files.
 
## Step 4: Play the Game
 
Now you are ready to play Call of Duty: Black Ops with multiplayer and zombies mode on your PC. Launch the game from the desktop shortcut or the game folder. If you are using BGamerT5 crack, you will need to create an account on their website and log in with it in the game[^3^]. You can also use sandboxie and WindowedBorderlessGaming to run two instances of the game on one PC and play with yourself[^3^]. Enjoy!
