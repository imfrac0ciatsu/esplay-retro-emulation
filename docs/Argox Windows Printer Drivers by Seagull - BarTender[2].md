#### Barcode Labels: What are they and why use them?
 
Barcode labels are labels that contain a series of black and white bars or dots that represent a unique code. The code can be scanned by a barcode reader or a smartphone camera and decoded into alphanumeric or numeric data. Barcode labels are widely used for identifying and tracking products, assets, inventory, documents, and other items.
 
Some of the benefits of using barcode labels are:
 
- They improve accuracy and efficiency by reducing human errors and speeding up data entry.
- They save time and money by eliminating the need for manual labeling and inventory management.
- They enhance security and compliance by providing traceability and verification of products and transactions.
- They increase customer satisfaction by providing faster service and delivery.

#### Barcode Labels: How to choose the right type?
 
There are many types of barcode labels available in the market, each with different characteristics and applications. Some of the factors to consider when choosing the right type of barcode label are:

- The size and shape of the label. The label should fit the item you want to label and have enough space for the barcode and any other information you want to include.
- The type and quality of the material. The material should be durable and resistant to abrasion, moisture, heat, chemicals, and other environmental conditions that may affect the readability of the barcode.
- The type and format of the barcode. The barcode should be compatible with the barcode reader or scanner you use and have enough capacity to store the data you need. There are different formats of barcodes such as linear (one-dimensional) barcodes, matrix (two-dimensional) barcodes, stacked barcodes, composite barcodes, etc.
- The printing method and software. The printing method should produce high-quality and clear barcodes that can be scanned easily. You can use direct thermal printing, thermal transfer printing, inkjet printing, laser printing, etc. You also need a software that can design and print barcode labels such as the Argox Special Edition BarTender software.
